    max_contamination: float (optional, default = 0.25)
        The maximum contamination value to use in outlier pruning -- once the multiplier increases
        contamination beyond this value the contamination used will simply be capped at this value.

    vector_metric: str (optional, default = "cosine")
        The metric to use on the source vector space. This is used to determine if cluster centroid representatives

    cluster_distance_threshold: float (optional, default = 0.025)

     do this we assume we have a ``text_representation`` providing a vector to each "word" such that the vectors exist in
     the *same* vector space as the ``vector_layers`` vector representations.

     Multiple layers of clusters are generated, with higher level layers having larger more general clusters. Each
     cluster is then labelled by the "words" closest to the cluster representation in the vector space. By default we
     avoid keyword re-use in layers by keeping track of which words have already been used in a layer (starting from
     the top layers and working downward to the finest grained layers), and exclude "words" that have already been
     used. This behaviour can be turned off if desired.

     Parameters
     ----------
     source_vectors: Array of shape (n_samples, n_features)
         The original high dimensional vector representation of the data

     map_representation: Array of shape (n_samples, n_map_features)
         The map representation of the data

     labelling_vectors: Array of shape (n_possible_labels, n_features)
         An array giving a vector (in the source vector space) for each potential label item

     labels: Dictionary mapping indices to label items
         A dictionary mapping from indices in the ``labelling_vectors`` array to labels (usually words)

     vector_metric: str (optional, default = "cosine")
         The metric to use on the source vector space.

     cluster_map_representation: bool (optional, default = False)
         Whether to directly cluster the map representation, or use UMAP to generate a representation for clustering
         using ``umap_n_components`` many dimensions.

     umap_n_components:
         The number of dimensions to use UMAP to reduce to if ``cluster_map_representation`` is ``False``.

     umap_n_neighbors: int (optional, default = 15)
         The number of neighbors to use for UMAP  if ``cluster_map_representation`` is ``False``.

     hdbscan_min_samples: int (optional, default = 10)
         The ``min_samples`` value to use with HDBSCAN for clustering.

     hdbscan_min_cluster_size: int (optional, default = 20)
         The ``min_cluster_size`` value to use with HDBSCAN for clustering.

     min_clusters: int (optional, default = 4)
         The number of clusters to have at the highest layer; layers with fewer than this number of clusters will
         be discarded

     contamination: float (optional, default = 0.05)
         The base contamination score used for outlier detection of fine grained clusters. Larger values will
         prune out more outliers

     contamination_multiplier: float (optional, default = 1.5)
         The value to multiply the contamination score by as we increase the layers -- thus applying
         higher contamination and removing more outliers from higher layers. Larger values will prune
         more aggressively

     max_contamination: float (optional, default = 0.25)
         The maximum contamination value to use in outlier pruning -- once the multiplier increases
         contamination beyond this value the contamination used will simply be capped at this value.

     cluster_distance_threshold: float (optional, default = 0.025)
         Cluster centroid representatives from a higher layer that are within this distance of an already selected
         cluster centroid in a lower layer will be ignored (so we don't repeat clusters)

     adjust_label_locations: bool (optional, default = True)
         Whether to attempt to adjust label locations to avoid overlaps with lower layers.

     label_adjust_spring_constant: float (optional, default = 0.1)
          The "optimal" distance from the source position; larger values will allow the adjusted cluster to move farther

    label_adjust_spring_constant_multiplier: float (optional, default = 1.5)
         We can increase the spring constant for higher level layers; to do this we multiply by the
         ``spring_constant_multiplier`` as we go up a layer. Smaller values (closer to 1.0) will ensure locations
         do no stray too far; this is particularly desireable in the case where there are many layers.

    label_adjust_edge_weight: float (optional, default = 1.0)
        How strong the springs pull

    items_per_label: int (optional, default = 3)
        The number of items to use for each cluster label

    pynnd_n_neighbors: int (optional, default = 40)
        The ``n_neighbors`` parameter to use for PyNNDescent for nearest neighbour lookups

    query_size: int (optional, default = 10)
        The number of nearest neighbors to return via PyNNDescent queries; this should be at *least* ``items_per_label``
        and often larger if ``exclude_keyword_reuse`` is ``True``.

    exclude_keyword_reuse: bool (optional, default = True)
        Whether to ensure keyword/labels don't get reused for lower level clusters.

    label_formatter: Function (optional, default = string_label_formatter)
        A function used for format a list of label items into a usable label (usually a single string).

    random_state: int or None (optional, default = None)
        A random state parameter which can be used to ensure fixed results for reproducibility.

     Attributes
     ----------
    labels: List of list of lists of label items
        A list of layers; each layer is a list of labels; each label is a list of label ``items_per_label`` many items

    location_layers: List of Arrays of shape (n_cluster_in_layer, n_map_features)
        A list of layers; each layer is an array of locations in the map representation to place the labels of that layer

    labels_for_display: List of list of labels
        A list of layers; each layer is a list of labels; each label is formatted for display use by ``label_formatter``

        The metric to use on the source vector space.

    cluster_map_representation: bool (optional, default = False)
        Whether to directly cluster the map representation, or use UMAP to generate a representation for clustering
        using ``umap_n_components`` many dimensions.

    umap_n_components:
        The number of dimensions to use UMAP to reduce to if ``cluster_map_representation`` is ``False``.

        be discarded

    contamination: float (optional, default = 0.05)
        The base contamination score used for outlier detection of fine grained clusters. Larger values will
        prune out more outliers

         ``spring_constant_multiplier`` as we go up a layer. Smaller values (closer to 1.0) will ensure locations
         do no stray too far; this is particularly desireable in the case where there are many layers.

class SampleLabelLayers(object):
    """Generate text labels for layers of clusters from data where each source vector has an associated label
    representation (usually text, usually a word). Multiple layers of clusters are generated, with higher level
    layers having larger more general clusters. Each cluster is then labelled by sampling labels from the points in
    the cluster. Various sampling strategies are available. The cheapest approach is ``"random"``. More advanced
    approaches are available via the apricot-select library which provides submodular-selection. Here we support
    ``"saturated_coverage"`` which is fast; ``"sum_redundancy"`` and ``"graph_cut"`` which are more expensive,
    but do a better coverage job; and ``"facility_location"`` which does the best job of ensuring diversity and
    coverage in the selection, but can be quite expensive computationally. ``"facility_selection"`` is definitely the
    best option if ``items_per_label`` is very large however.
